# Retail Dashboard App

An ecommerce idea called ByteShop, with a simulation of buying computers.
A modern, full-featured retail dashboard for managing and browsing products, simulating purchases, and visualizing sales and inventory data.  
This project is split into two repositories:

- **retail-dashboard-app**: Client-side (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets)
- **retail-dashboard-app-server**: Server-side (Node.js, Express, JSON data)

## About the Project
This project was developed as a real-world simulation of an online retail platform.  
It allows users to browse products, view details and reviews, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases.  
Admins can access a dashboard with interactive charts (using Chart.js) to monitor inventory, sales, and review analytics.  
All data is persisted locally using JSON files (server) and Web Storage API (client).
